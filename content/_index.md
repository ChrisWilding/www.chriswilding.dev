# Hi, I'm Chris Wilding

I'm a software engineer living and working in Manchester, UK.

If you want to find our more about me take a look at my [about me](#about-me) section. If you want to get in touch contact me through [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/ChrisWildingUK) or by [email](mailto:hello@chriswilding.dev).

I occasionally tweet as [@ChrisWildingUK](https://twitter.com/@ChrisWildingUK).

## About Me

I'm a full stack software engineer delivering complex enterprise applications for large organisations.

In my spare time I love trying out new languages and tools. Take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/ChrisWilding) profile; it contains a mixture of coding exercises, previous technical tests and some small applications I have used to learn and experiment with a new framework, language or technology.
